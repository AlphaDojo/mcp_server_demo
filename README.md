This is a demo MCP (Modular Content Protocol) server built with FastMCP in Python.
It showcases several software design patterns, including Singleton, Factory, and Builder, in a practical setting.

The server currently provides:

Player stats tools – retrieve baseball player stats using a Singleton PlayerDataManager.

Player report generation – create different types of player reports using a Factory pattern.

Customizable player profiles – build player profiles step-by-step using a Builder pattern.

Dynamic greeting tools – generate personalized greetings for any user.

This project is intended as a learning and demonstration platform for Python developers exploring design patterns and modular server design.
